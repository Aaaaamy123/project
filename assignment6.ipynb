    "The goal is to build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a patient has **heart disease (1)** or not (0), using clinical data from the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**. The dataset includes **303 patient records** with **13 features**, such as age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results. The original target variable `num` ranges from 0 to 4, indicating increasing severity of heart disease. For binary classification, it is transformed into `0` (no heart disease) and `1` (presence of heart disease) if `num` > 0.\n",

    "- **Variable Type Identification**:  \n",
    "  Based on the official UCI dataset documentation and domain knowledge:\n",
    "  - **Continuous numerical variables**: `age`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalach`, and `oldpeak` were treated as numerical, since they are measured on ratio or interval scales with meaningful numeric ranges. The variable `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) is inherently an integer-valued numerical feature. Since it is already in the correct format, no type conversion is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Categorical/discrete variables**: Variables such as `sex`, `cp`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `exang`, `slope`, and `thal` are encoded as integers but represent discrete categories. This classification is supported by the original dataset description. For example, `cp` (chest pain type) ranges from 1 to 4 representing distinct medical conditions, and `thal` represents different thalassemia test results (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Value Identification**:  \n",
    "  The features `ca` and `thal` include missing values, which were parsed as `NaN` using the `ucimlrepo` loader. No imputation or deletion was applied at this stage, as missing value handling is addressed in Question 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardization**:  \n",
    "  Standardization was applied to continuous numerical features (`age`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalach`, and `oldpeak`) using z-score normalization. The range of `ca` is integer with narrow range so no standadization is implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Even though standardization is **not strictly necessary** for all classification algorithms, it is beneficial for scale-sensitive models such as logistic regression, SVM, and k-NN.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps ensured that the dataset was clean, properly typed, and ready for downstream modeling and analysis."
